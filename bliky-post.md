CL-BLIKY
<title>


I 'm writting this using a self rolled blog engine called cl-bliky. I'm indebted to an excellent
[tutorial](http://roeim.net/vetle/docs/cl-webapp-intro/) put together by [Vetle Roeim](http://roeim.net/vetle/). 
Vetle's goal was obviously to put together a compelling tutorial and he succeeded. 
I had different goals.

<split>

First was to use lisp in a small programming project.
Secondly, I wanted to use something very simple, which I could easily customize.
In addition I wanted to use github pages [github pages](http://pages.github.com) as a publishing platform.


cl-bliky , [as per](http://roeim.net/vetle/docs/cl-webapp-intro/) is a simple 
[hunchentoot](http://www.weitz.de/hunchentoot/) web server. 
[elephant](http://common-lisp.net/project/elephant/) with [Berley DB](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html) is used to store the posts 
on the local disk. 

Posts can be written in html and markdown. 
I'm using [cl-markdown](http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-markdown/) to translate markdown to html.

Posts can be edited or uploaded using a web interface. 

Pushing the posts to the local or remote git repository is straight forward. I used sbcl's proprietary 
sb-ext to accomplish this. I haven't tried to use other lisp implenmentations.

Posts can be recreated from the git repo. I do this by sprinkling the html generated by bliky with various 
"<div id=.." tags. That allows me to indentify the various pieces I need to recreate the underlying object. 
I use [cl-html-parse](http://www.cliki.net/CL-HTML-Parse) to do this, 
  followed by [htmlgen](http://www.cliki.net/htmlgen) to recreate the html in the posts. 

There is some loss in fidelity, since I don't translate the html back to markdown. 
Also, things delimited by brackets <> are interpreted as tags by the 
[cl-html-parse](http://www.cliki.net/CL-HTML-Parse)
